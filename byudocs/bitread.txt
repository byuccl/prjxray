In the tools directory there is a program called bitread.cc which
reads bitstreams and spits them out in different formats.  This
document simply summarizes how to use it since it may have use in the
project.

Fuzzer Usage:

A typical fuzzer uses this tool near the end of its processing.  Once
a set of .bit files are created, it uses this tool to convert those to
.bits files.  This is typically done with the following command:

	${XRAY_BITREAD} -F $XRAY_ROI_FRAMES -o ${x}s -z -y $x

where $x is the name of a .bit file to process

    The -F option specifies the range of frames to process.

    The -o option specifies to output a .bits file.

    The -z option says to skip frames which are all zeroes.

    The -y option says to use format 'bit_%%08x_%%03d_%%02d' when
    outputting bits that are set in the bitstream.

To find differences between two bitstreams the fuzzer then usually
does a diff between two of the readable .bits files and dumps that
into .delta files.

Interactive Usage:

You can use this to dump out different versions of the bitstream.  For
example:

        ${XRAY_BITREAD} -F $XRAY_ROI_FRAMES < design.bit

will print frames to the screen as in:

        Bitstream size: 2298099 bytes
        Config size: 574487 words
        Number of configuration frames: 5408

        Frame 0x00020500 (Type=0 Top=0 Row=1 Column=10 Minor=0):
        02400000 00000000 02410000 00000000 0a400000 00010000
        00000000 00000000 00000000 00000000 00000000 00000000
        00000000 00000000 00000000 00000000 00000000 00000000
        00000000 00000000 00000000 00000000 00000000 00000000

Adding the -y option will give:

        Bitstream size: 2298099 bytes
        Config size: 574487 words
        Number of configuration frames: 5408
        
        Frame 0x00020500 (Type=0 Top=0 Row=1 Column=10 Minor=0):
        bit_00020500_000_22
        bit_00020500_000_25
        bit_00020500_002_16
        bit_00020500_002_22

where the fields are frame address, word, bit.  This is the format the
fuzzers give.  Note, that by default only bits that are turned on are printed.
Also, only bits in word 50 after the CRC bits are printed unless you
specify the -C option (in which case all of on-bits of word 50 are printed).

Or, adding the -x option will give:

        Bitstream size: 2298099 bytes
        Config size: 574487 words
        Number of configuration frames: 5408
        
        Frame 0x00020500 (Type=0 Top=0 Row=1 Column=10 Minor=0):
        bit_00020500_000_22_t0_h0_r1_c10_m0
        bit_00020500_000_25_t0_h0_r1_c10_m0
        bit_00020500_002_16_t0_h0_r1_c10_m0
        bit_00020500_002_22_t0_h0_r1_c10_m0

where the different fields separated by _'s give even more information
than above.

There are a bunch more options.  See the code.
